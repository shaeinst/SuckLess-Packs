This is suckless, mmmbud, the source code is the documentation! Check out `config.h`.

## Please install `libxft-rbgra`!

This build of dwm does not block color emoji in the status/info bar, so you must install [libxft-rbgra](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/) from the AUR, which fixes a libxft color emoji rendering problem, otherwise dwm will crash upon trying to render one. Hopefully this fix will be in all libxft soon enough.
